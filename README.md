# ESE-2000 Lab Solutions

This repository contains solutions for labs in the ESE 2000 course at UPenn.
Solutions prior to lab 6 were made during the course and were based of solutions given in class.
Solutions for Lab 6 and onwards were produced independently by [Teresa Shang](mailto:tshang@seas.upenn.edu) and [Varun Chitturi](mailto:varchi@seas.upenn.edu) with guidance from [Alejandro Ribeiro](mailto:aribeiro@seas.upenn.edu), [Dongsheng Ding](mailto:dongshed@seas.upenn.edu),
[Javier Porras-Valenzuela](mailto:jporras@seas.upenn.edu), [Sergio Rozada](mailto:s.rozada.2019@alumnos.urjc.es) and [Shervin Khalafi](mailto:shervink@seas.upenn.edu).

Research papers and online references were used to assist solutions.
