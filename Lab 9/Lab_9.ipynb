    "We can think of language as a time series. In this interpretation, each word in a sentence corresponds to the equivalent of a different point in time and the words themselves represent different vectors of the time series. Consider as an example the first lines spoken by Miranda in The Tempest\\footnote{In honor of the best Miranda.}:\n",

    "If we interpret language as a time series, we can use a transformer to predict the next word in a sequence as we did in Chapter 5. If we then execute this predictor recursively, we can use it to predict several words in a sequence. This is a strategy for generating language.\n",

    "## Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "A simple approach is to encode words in the index of a long vector. Formally, suppose that we are given a collection of texts that collectively contain a total of $c$ words. We then consider a set of $c$ vectors $\\mathbf{e}_i$ whose length is also $c$. These vectors have all zero entries except for the $i$th entry which we set to 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(\\mathbf{e}_i)_i = 1 \\quad \\text{~and~} \\quad \n",
    "(\\mathbf{e}_i)_j = 0 \\text{~~for~~} i \\neq j.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the vector $\\mathbf{e}_i$ to encode the $i$th word in the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "In corpuses used in practice, we have thousands of different words and anywhere between hundreds of thousands to trillions of sentences. In this lab, we work with a subset of Shakespeare's plays which contains $c = 14,295$ different words and a total of 292,072 words in the corpus. But to illustrate ideas, let us work with a corpus made up of just two quotes:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *If by your art, my dearest father, you have put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.*  \n",
    "> *Sir, are not you my father?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this corpus, we have a total of 24 different words including 3 punctuation marks. We therefore represent the words in the corpus with $c = 24$ vectors of length $c = 24$. Proceeding in the order of the sentence, the vector $\\mathbf{e}_1 = [1, 0, \\ldots, 0]$ represents the word “If,” the vector $\\mathbf{e}_2 = [0, 1, 0, \\ldots, 0]$ represents the word “by,” and so on. The word “father” is the eighth word that appears in the sentence and is therefore represented by the vector $\\mathbf{e}_8$. This vector's value at index 8 is $(\\mathbf{e}_8)_8 = 1$ and all of its other entries are zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the same word appears again in the corpus, we encode it with the same vector. For example, when the word “father” appears a second time, we still encode it with the vector $\\mathbf{e}_8$. This also happens with the comma (“,”) which appears three times and is encoded with the vector $\\mathbf{e}_5$ in all three appearances, and with the words “my” and “you” that appear twice and are encoded in the vectors $\\mathbf{e}_6$ and $\\mathbf{e}_9$. So encoded, our corpus becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "> $\\mathbf{e}_1 \\quad \\mathbf{e}_2 \\quad \\mathbf{e}_3 \\quad \\mathbf{e}_4 \\quad \\mathbf{e}_5 \\quad \\mathbf{e}_6 \\quad \\mathbf{e}_7 \\quad \\mathbf{e}_8 \\quad \\mathbf{e}_5 \\quad \\mathbf{e}_9 \\quad \\mathbf{e}_{10}$  \n",
    "> $\\mathbf{e}_{11} \\quad \\mathbf{e}_{12} \\quad \\mathbf{e}_{13} \\quad \\mathbf{e}_{14} \\quad \\mathbf{e}_{15} \\quad \\mathbf{e}_{16} \\quad \\mathbf{e}_{17} \\quad \\mathbf{e}_5$  \n",
    "> $\\mathbf{e}_{18} \\quad \\mathbf{e}_{19} \\quad \\mathbf{e}_{20}$  \n",
    "> $\\mathbf{e}_{21} \\quad \\mathbf{e}_5 \\quad \\mathbf{e}_{22} \\quad \\mathbf{e}_{23} \\quad \\mathbf{e}_9 \\quad \\mathbf{e}_6 \\quad \\mathbf{e}_8 \\quad \\mathbf{e}_{24}$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a defilement of Shakespeare's work. However, this representation of the corpus can be processed with numerical techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoding language with these index vectors is not creative and does not work well. We discuss more interesting and useful word embeddings in the next section.\n"

This is a text file containing around 40,000 lines of dialogue from Shakespeare's plays. Split the text into words, defined here to include punctuation marks and line breaks. We associate words with vectors $\\mathbf{e}_i$ as in equation $(1)$. Since it would be wasteful to store vectors in which all but one entry is 0, we just store the index of the vector that represents each individual word.

    "## Cooccurrence Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "To create richer word embeddings, we leverage the cooccurrence matrix $\\mathbf{C}$. To construct this matrix, we consider a window of length $W + 1$ and scan the corpus for joint occurrences of words $\\mathbf{e}_i$ and $\\mathbf{e}_j$. The cooccurrence $C_{ij}$ is the number of times that $\\mathbf{e}_j$ appears in a window centered at $\\mathbf{e}_i$. If we index the corpus by an index $t$ and use $\\mathbf{w}_t$ to represent the $t$th word in the corpus, we can write cooccurrences as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "C_{ij} = \\sum_t \\mathbb{I}(\\mathbf{w}_t = \\mathbf{e}_i) = \\sum_{u = -W/2}^{u = W/2} \\mathbb{I}(\\mathbf{w}_u = \\mathbf{e}_j),\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we assume that the window is even for simplicity. In the above equation, the first indicator function $\\mathbb{I}(\\mathbf{w}_t = \\mathbf{e}_i) = 1$ only when the window is centered at $\\mathbf{w}_t$ and $\\mathbf{w}_t = \\mathbf{e}_i$. The second indicator function $\\mathbb{I}(\\mathbf{w}_u = \\mathbf{e}_j) = 1$ whenever the word $\\mathbf{e}_j$ appears in the window centered at $\\mathbf{w}_t$. Thus, the second sum counts the number of times that $\\mathbf{e}_j$ appears centered in a window centered at $\\mathbf{w}_t = \\mathbf{e}_i$. The first sum is counting the number of times that $\\mathbf{e}_i$ appears in the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The cooccurrence matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ is relevant because related words tend to appear near each other, and they also tend to appear next to words that indicate their relationships. In an extensive corpus, we expect to find several cooccurrences of the words “birds” and “fly,” indicating that these two words are related. We do not expect to see many cooccurrences of “dogs” and “fly” because dogs do not fly. We also expect to see cooccurrences of the words “bird” and “albatross” and of the words “bird” and “swallow,” indicating that there is some relationship between “albatross” and “swallow.”\n",
    "\n",
    "We highlight that the cooccurrence matrix $\\mathbf{C}$ is symmetric:\n",

    "\\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad\n",
    "C_{ij} = C_{ji}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because whenever the word $\\mathbf{e}_j$ appears in a window centered at an occurrence of the word $\\mathbf{e}_i$, these two words are less than $W/2$ words apart. This implies that the word $\\mathbf{e}_i$ must appear in a window centered at an occurrence of the word $\\mathbf{e}_j$.\n"
